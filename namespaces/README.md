The program, which emulates the work with namespaces.
Implemented support for creating a namespace and adding variables to them.

In this task, each namespace has a unique text identifier - its name.

Input format
The first line contains the number n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) - the number of requests.
In each of the following n lines, one request is given.
Queries are executed in the order in which they are given in the input data.
Namespace names and variable names are strings of length no more than 10, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.

Output Format
For each get query, output its result in a separate line.


Namespaces in Python are implemented as Python dictionaries, this means it is a mapping from names (keys) to objects (values). The user doesn't have to know this to write a Python program and when using namespaces. ... local names in a function or method invocation.
